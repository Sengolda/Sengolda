### Moving on... Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am mostly a backend developer and have sometimes done somethings with DevOps tools like Docker:
  - I am most experienced with python and javascript
  - I have made python modules
  - I have contributed to some famous projects, such as [py-cord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASengolda+), [PyTweet](https://github.com/PyTweet/PyTweet/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASengolda)

### Quotes
- A random programming quote from the [hourly quote generator](auto_update.py) 
- Quote for the hour is:

```
The notions of correctness in mathematics and programs are different. A mathematical model must be consistent; it need not match reality (be correct), and it need not be complete (in the formal sense). A program model must be consistent; it must match reality; and it must be complete (in the sense that it reacts gracefully to all inputs).
  - Daniel T. Barry
```
