### Moving on... Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am mostly a backend developer and have sometimes done somethings with DevOps tools like Docker:
  - I am most experienced with python and javascript
  - I have made python modules
  - I have contributed to some famous projects, such as [py-cord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASengolda+), [PyTweet](https://github.com/PyTweet/PyTweet/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASengolda)
