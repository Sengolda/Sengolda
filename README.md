### Moving on... Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am mostly a backend developer and have sometimes done somethings with DevOps tools like Docker:
  - I am most experienced with python and javascript
  - I have made python modules
  - I have contributed to some famous projects, such as [py-cord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASengolda+), [PyTweet](https://github.com/PyTweet/PyTweet/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASengolda)

### Quotes
- A random programming quote from the [hourly quote generator](auto_update.py) 
- Quote for the hour is:

```
The errors which arise from the absence of facts are far more numerous and more durable than those which result from unsound reasoning respecting true data.
  - Charles Babbage
```
